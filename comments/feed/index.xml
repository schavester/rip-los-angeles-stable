					<description><![CDATA[It was ugly today at the Planning and Land Use Management Committee, as citizens cried corruption and the newly elected &quot;reform&quot; Councilmember Nithya Raman was MIA, which allowed the developer claim to have her support--and the citizens to counter no, she supported them. The story is in our live tweets: https://twitter.com/esotouric/status/1352331219686588421]]></description>

The desecration that is happening here in East Hollywood is TRULY DISGUSTING! It started when Garcetti was over this district and has continued with all the other goons that have come since him. It’s so sad to see how the homeless population has increased and continues to increase. Please bring back humanity! STOP THE HOME STEALING!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s great to have you back on the threatened building beat, Nathan. Too many of these fine places are falling to the completely discretionary TOC upzoning scam that enriches politicians and causes grave harm to the commons. The work you&#039;re doing is important. Your books are amazing, too!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Nathan,
Thank you for this history. I really appreciate the &#039;Bank&#039; history of Liquor Bank via B of A.
I&#039;m doing cyanotypes and handmade negatives of developments in process (via the designers&#039; renderings), and in this case want to do one just of the Liquor Bank&#039;s intersection.
In any case, thanks again...i&#039;m sure there&#039;s plenty of RIP in the Crenshaw/Leimert areas to keep track of...]]></description>

Hey Paul——well I agree with everything you say, except for the final sentence (as you might imagine).  The house needs a lot of love, but it&#039;s not so far gone that it can&#039;t be brought back.  Maybe it&#039;s not a great block, or the best neighborhood for old houses (though there&#039;s some nifty old houses still on 12th, and Edgehill, even a couple on Norton) but I&#039;d say that&#039;s exactly the &lt;em&gt;point&lt;/em&gt; of our needing to retain this one; it&#039;s like the last of its kind in the area.  A lot of people replying to the Instagram post were all &quot;oh no!  I know that house—I drive by it all the time and always notice it&quot; because it&#039;s something of a landmark in those parts.  If it vanishes then kids will grow up thinking the area was &quot;born&quot; into hacked n&#039; whacked, without a touchstone of how it once was.]]></description>
