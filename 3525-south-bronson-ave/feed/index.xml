Hey Paul——well I agree with everything you say, except for the final sentence (as you might imagine).  The house needs a lot of love, but it&#039;s not so far gone that it can&#039;t be brought back.  Maybe it&#039;s not a great block, or the best neighborhood for old houses (though there&#039;s some nifty old houses still on 12th, and Edgehill, even a couple on Norton) but I&#039;d say that&#039;s exactly the &lt;em&gt;point&lt;/em&gt; of our needing to retain this one; it&#039;s like the last of its kind in the area.  A lot of people replying to the Instagram post were all &quot;oh no!  I know that house—I drive by it all the time and always notice it&quot; because it&#039;s something of a landmark in those parts.  If it vanishes then kids will grow up thinking the area was &quot;born&quot; into hacked n&#039; whacked, without a touchstone of how it once was.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I went to the house on Bronson on Sunday to check it out.  It&#039;s a complete mess on an odd lot next to a giant mega church. Plus every building on that block is some 1 story muli-family dwelling.  What&#039;s tragic to me is what the neighborhood has gone through. Butchered, hacked and whacked into this odd mess.  As much as I love history and saving the old, this is the first time I am ever agreeing to just tear this down.]]></description>
