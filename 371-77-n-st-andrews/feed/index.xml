					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;This lovely building was demolished before the date you listed for the permit. I think it was pulled down last fall of winter. After the property was acquired by a developer, they got all the tenants out, then sort of boarded the place up. Naturally, the local homeless community took up residence immediately. They responded by boarding it up a little more securely. That last a few weeks. Eventually, it caught fire. Happily, no one was injured but the roof burned and the building had to be pulled down. We live on this block and construction on the new structures (there are two or three because the developer also acquired the house next door) has been well under way since spring. While your photos show many of the beautiful older buildings still standing in the immediate vicinity, there are in fact four other new construction projects within just a few feet of this one. All are the hideous, boxey eyesores that developers favor. There are now more new buildings than old on these two blocks of Elmwood and Oakwood. It’s depressing.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;this was torn down over a year and a half ago.  the young and old people were evicted without payment, and the only good thing is the construction crew, or the owners are letting some unhoused invididuals live in a small corner.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I live on the 500 block of North St Andrews Place&lt;/p&gt;
