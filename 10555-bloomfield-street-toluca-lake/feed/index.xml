					<description><![CDATA[It was ugly today at the Planning and Land Use Management Committee, as citizens cried corruption and the newly elected &quot;reform&quot; Councilmember Nithya Raman was MIA, which allowed the developer claim to have her support--and the citizens to counter no, she supported them. The story is in our live tweets: https://twitter.com/esotouric/status/1352331219686588421]]></description>

Some photos and a video walk around are at https://www.instagram.com/p/B3gPylcBDns/]]></description>
