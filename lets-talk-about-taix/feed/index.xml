					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m so crushed by the pending loss of so many  collective memories and the erasure of this establishment. There was originally talk of maintaining the facade &#038; porte cohere along with the front rooms for some historic preservation but this seems to have disappeared.
Now we have another banal unimaginative and expensive building that could be anywhere.... a real tragedy!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[seriously, I ask this seriously...why are curbed readers such douches? I went to Taix&#039;s (sic) with my dad in the late 50s. It was cool then and its cool now.  The soul deadening architecture of what laughingly passes for affordable apartment space is what is making American culture a wasteland of banality.]]></description>
