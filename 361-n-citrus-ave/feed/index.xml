					<description><![CDATA[Just found out about this and am horrified about this tragedy caused by one greedy and lying person and poor government. The demolition permit was basically rubber stamped! As a developer he knew how to work the system to make sure this happened. And he planned this from day 1.  Has anyone considered that this could be part of a larger plan (he is a developer)?  Why go to these lengths to destroy one of the most beautiful and historic homes in the neighborhood? He could have bought and demolished any home. So why this one?  Is he planning a larger scale development for the neighborhood which starts with destroying the historical character of the neighborhood by knocking down the cornerstones?  That would ease the path for future developments through the neighborhood. There is nothing to protect or fight over once it’s gone. This may sound far fetched but really, why else would he go to these lengths of deception and speed, just to destroy this gem of a house?]]></description>

As horrible as this is destroying such a beautiful house, and the devious and immoral way the buyers lied and persuaded the sellers into choosing them, i find it even more disgraceful that when they demolished it that nothing was salvaged.  There is a house across the street from mr being demolished, but instead of bulldozing, it appears they salvaged the Spanish roof tiles. the wood framing, etc.  There have only been bulldozers at the end.  I am saddened to see yhe house go down and hope an architecturally appropriate house iis built in its stead.  Going back to 361, I fear that Graydon&#039;s idea of a beautiful house is a modern flat roofed white monstrosity that looms over its neighbors.  He has proven himself to be selfish. Not trustworthy and completely oblivious of the welfare of his neighbors.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As a Jew myself I am
ashamed at this disgusting person.  How dare he wear a yarmulke while committing crimes of deceit and more.  He should not wear a yarmulke and not represent himself as a “religious” Jew.   G-d is no doubt ashamed at his actions and one day he alone will face judgment by the creator.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is REVOLTING!  OK, so we all know Gradon is a major pile of feces, but what can be done?  Is the city going after him in any way?  Can the good residents of Hancock Park take some sort of action against this turd?  Please tell me this walking colostomy bag is not going to get away with this!]]></description>

When I read this article about this GRAND , BEAUTIFUL JEWEL of a home being torn down in the name of GREED , and the ALMIGHTY DOLLAR , I WANTED TO PUKE !!!!!  The letter sent to the previous owners was no more than FRAUD and should have legal actions taken against REUVEN GRADON for the lying snake that he is !!!!!!!!!!  I have never been more angry than I was when I read his &quot; LETTER &quot; myself !!  It shook me to my very core !!!  This is what we&#039;ve come to as a society and it makes me sick and breaks my heart !!  Homes such as this one WAS , are treasures of beauty and historic significance !  I would certainly make sure that he never sells anything he puts on the property where this grand home once stood !!!  Our history is being erased and we will suffer the losses unless we stand against this kind of thievery !!!!!!!!!!!!!!]]></description>

How awful to have to watch Ray Bradbury&#039;s home being destroyed by &quot;starchitect&quot; Thom Mayne, who worked the system to squeak his demolition in right under the wire where neighbors and fans would have been able to challenge it. 

Just a quick note: there is more than one Bradbury daughter, and the one I know was heartbroken by what happened to the family house.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Unfortunately, THIS is the prime example of how dirty and money driven our society has become, Clearly is a degree holder in “The Art of the Deal”, because he’s just as slimy as the “author” of that book. People who own homes such as this, should learn from this dirty deal, and have their homes declared historical landmarks (if possible), or in the very least, not fall for BS like The Gradons’, and realized that he was sleazy as soon as he declared that he was a real estate investor.]]></description>

Regardless of whether it is, or isn’t, we saw exactly how thorough the City was at verifying the legality and validity of this creep’s actions, since they granted the demo permit WITHOUT architectural plans. Seems like true Los Angeles style.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What a complete disregard for our beautiful and unique community. I blame the councilman, and city department for not protecting our community. instead selling us out to donors who sit in political offices, and their appointee&#039;s to head City departments. seeing this house tore down makes me cry.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am a very skillful designer and have studied historic details my entire career. I am far better than most other designers. Even with my sophisticated skills I can’t even come close to designing the details of the razed home. For all the details I have drawn there is no artisan today can create them. I often have to settle for less than perfect craftsmanship and execution. Money can buy a lot of thing but never can create a new home with the historical charm.]]></description>
