<p>For the record, let me state at the outset: I revere the Catholic faith. I believe the Church to have had a vastly civilizing influence on humanity—<em>yes</em>, an enormously unpopular opinion, as society now considers <a href="https://abc7.com/junipero-serra-statue-toppled-downtown-la-california-mission-history/6258309/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">statue</a> <a href="https://www.marinij.com/2021/02/17/activists-urge-marin-da-to-drop-church-vandalism-case/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">destruction</a> and <a href="https://www.wkrg.com/state-regional/florida-man-charged-with-arson-and-burning-down-a-catholic-church/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">church</a> <a href="https://laist.com/2020/07/12/san_gabriel_mission_fire_catholics_investigation_suspected_arson_junipero_serra.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">burning</a> the ideal Sunday outing. Do admit, though, what are your temples of the Enlightenment compared to the Cattedrale di Santa Maria del Fiore or York Minster or Nantes Cathedral (or what&#8217;s <a href="https://rmx.news/article/article/france-rwandan-migrant-confesses-to-setting-nantes-cathedral-on-fire" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">left of it</a>)?</p>



<p>Point being, in that I love its doctrine and architecture (above and beyond any fetish for thuribles and a preference for Jameson over Bushmills) I don&#8217;t want it to seem that I&#8217;m <em>picking</em> on the Church—but.</p>



<p>The Church in Los Angeles has had a troubling history with historic buildings, religious and otherwise. Let&#8217;s look at just a smattering:</p>



<p><em><strong>The Oviatt Building</strong>.</em> James Oviatt&#8217;s eponymous high-rise <a href="http://bigorangelandmarks.blogspot.com/2008/11/no-195-oviatt-building.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">haberdashery/office tower</a> (Walker &amp; Eisen, 1928) is one of the great Art Deco monuments of Los Angeles, and therefore the world, known for its cut glass, rare woods, neon clock tower and <a href="https://www.flickr.com/search/?text=oviatt%20penthouse" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">incredible penthouse</a>. Mr. Oviatt was renting the land on which the tower sat from the Archdiocese. In the late 1960s-early &#8217;70s, with demand for non-polyester clothing on the outs, Oviatt tried to sell his building, to pay back rent owed to the Archdiocese. The Archdiocese sabotaged several escrow attempts by making financially unfeasible demands (installation of central air, replacement of the elevators, etc.) on potential buyers. James Oviatt died in 1974 and the building&#8217;s trustees voted to give the structure to the Archdiocese in forgiveness of past rent. The Archdiocese immediately put the building on the market as a teardown, informing realtors it would provide the ideal site for a multistory parking garage.</p>

<p><em><strong>St. Joseph&#8217;s.</strong></em> Los Angeles was once a forest of church spires, few as prominent as the twin spires of St. Joseph Catholic Church, dedicated on the Feast of St. Joseph, May 3, 1903, at 12th and Los Angeles Streets. Saint Joseph&#8217;s architects were Brothers Adrian Wewer and Leonard Darscheidt, German Franciscan monks famed for their church designs. St. Joseph&#8217;s was heavily damaged in a September 1983 fire that collapsed the roof, but the walls stood fast and the towers remained. The Cultural Heritage Board reasoned with the Archdiocese that the surviving elements of the church—declared Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Monument #16 some twenty years earlier, in 1963—could be easily rebuilt. But the Church would have none of it, and demolished the structure, to build a modern edifice.</p>

<p><em><strong>Cathedral of St. Vibiana</strong></em>. This tale is so famous it hardly bears repeating. But anyway: St. Vibiana&#8217;s—our first Cathedral, and parish of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese—was built in 1876 and designed by Ezra Frank Kysor of Kysor &amp; Mathews, basing its design loosely on Barcelona&#8217;s 1755 Sant Miquel del Port; famed architect John C. Austin made the façade less Baroque and more Roman when he oversaw additions in 1922. Vibiana&#8217;s importance to the Church is one thing, but its importance to Los Angeles in general is so deep and undeniable I won&#8217;t even begin to elucidate.</p>



<p>His Eminence Cardinal Roger Mahony wanted to tear down the 1876 Cathedral. After the 1994 Northridge earthquake, his structural engineer told him the structure was sound, although the bell tower required shoring; the Church did not shore the bell tower. In May 1996 Mahony began the process of removing statuary and the windows of the structure; illegal for a Historic-Cultural Monument. On June 1, 1996—early on a Saturday morning (and when, conveniently, all of LA&#8217;s top preservationists happened to be away at a conference in San Jose)—demolition crews set to work illegally demolishing the structure. Concerned parties rushed to the site but were ignored by guards at the fence; it took a Superior Court Judge to get him to stop.</p>

<p><p style="text-align: left;">Mahony thought he had an ace in the hole. He kept repeating &#8220;if you don&#8217;t let us tear this down, we&#8217;ll move out of downtown!&#8221; But nobody was buying that. Everyone rememberd, for example, when in 1982 the Gas Company at Eighth and Flower said &#8220;if you don&#8217;t let us tear down neighboring <a href="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/urbanfoundation/pages/37/attachments/original/1401231710/1st_church_8th___hope.jpg?1401231710" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">First Methodist</a> to expand our building, we&#8217;ll move out of downtown!&#8221; So <a href="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50964078842_f09f82a6c9_o.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">despite protest</a>, they were allowed to demolish First Methodist (John C. Austin, 1923), all its Tiffany mosaics and stained glass, wood paneling and terra cotta, and then the Gas Company said &#8220;oh yeah sorry, we&#8217;re actually gonna build something new a few blocks north at Fifth and Olive&#8221; &#8230;and First Methodist remained a parking lot for 35 years.</p></p>



<p>A legal battle ensued, St. Vibiana did <em>not</em> become a parking lot, and Mahony finally swapped his little church for six acres of County land bordered by Grand, Temple, Hill, and the Hollywood Freeway.&nbsp; Mahony’s stripped-down, deconstructivist, $250 million church broke ground in September 1997 and was consecrated in September 2002. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Which brings us to <em>today&#8217;s topic</em>.</p>



<p><em><strong>B&#8217;nai B&#8217;rith, 846 South Union Ave. (S. Tilden Norton, 1924)</strong></em>. You might be asking, what does a Hebrew congregation have to do with the Catholic church? Well.</p>



<p>First of all, do not confuse the B&#8217;nai B&#8217;rith about which we are speaking with <em>Congregation B&#8217;nai B&#8217;rith</em>—LA&#8217;s first (chartered) Hebrew temple began in 1862, Congregation B&#8217;nai B&#8217;rith first holding services in their<a href="https://farm6.static.flickr.com/5025/5854470687_f91a83d8fc_o.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Ezra Kyzor-designed synagogue </a>on Fort Street (now Broadway) between Second and Third in 1873; in 1896 B&#8217;nai B&#8217;rith moved further south, to Ninth and Hope, to a grand new <a href="https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3064/5855022156_a28b992f6e_z.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">onion-domed temple</a> designed by Abraham Moses Edelman (son of chief rabbi, Abram Wolf Edelman); they then moved further west, and built <a href="https://www.laconservancy.org/locations/wilshire-boulevard-temple" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of the greatest synagogues in the world</a> in 1929, and changed their name to Wilshire Boulevard Temple.</p>



<p>Rather, we are discussing B&#8217;nai B&#8217;rith, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%27nai_B%27rith" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">service organization</a> (which also functioned very much like a fraternal lodge). The International Order of B&#8217;nai B&#8217;rith, begun in New York in 1843, founded its Los Angeles chapter, Orange Lodge No. 224, in 1874, and another, Semi-Tropic Lodge in 1883; they merged to become Lodge 487 in 1899. In the 1880s B&#8217;nai B&#8217;rith met at Bryson&#8217;s Hall on Spring Street; in January 1904, when they had 170 members, they dedicated a fine new hall at 521 West Pico. By 1918 they had moved to a new lodge hall at 17th &amp; Georgia. In the January 13, 1922 issue of <em>The B&#8217;nai B&#8217;rith Messenger</em>, under notices about Lodge 487:</p>

<p><p style="text-align: left;">Note that their stated goals were 2,000 members and a new building. They achieved both: at 2,000 members in 1923, Lodge 487 became the largest B&#8217;nai B&#8217;rith Lodge in the nation. And, they built a swanky new building:</p></p>

<p>It contained &#8220;two large lodge-rooms, banquet hall, dancing floors, library, kitchen, elevators, committee-rooms, spacious lobby, gymnasium, shower baths and eight handsome stores&#8221; according to&nbsp;<a href="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50966601578_cd04797a27_o.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this</a>.

<p>S. Tilden Norton is of such glaring importance to Los Angeles&#8217;s built environment that&#8230;I won&#8217;t make this post any longer by detailing his work here.

<p>The International Order of B&#8217;nai B&#8217;rith settled in, and did <a href="https://homesteadmuseum.blog/2018/11/17/searching-for-henry-schwartz-a-letter-from-the-los-angeles-lodge-487-independent-order-of-bnai-brith-17-november-1924/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">their good works</a>, <a href="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50967666388_ca4d57e872_o.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">having concerts</a>, etc.</p>



<p>By the mid-1930s, the IOBB 487 have moved, presumably because of the Depression, into a room at 742 South Hill St. 846 South Union becomes the home of other fraternal organizations, like the Blue Devils Post of the American Legion and the Los Angeles Aerie 102 Fraternal Order of Eagles. In 1938 it becomes a little more labor-related, when the&nbsp;<a href="https://onlinescea.weebly.com/about-scea.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Safeway Employees Association</a>moves in. By 1942 it was a full-blown temple of labor, as the former B&#8217;nai B&#8217;rith was now home to Bakery Drivers 276, Dump Truck Drivers 420, Warehousemens 598, Grocery Warehousemens 595, Dairy Haulers 737, Milk Wagon Drivers 93, Meat and Provision Drivers 626, Truck Drivers 208 and 403, Hay Haulers 737, Garage Automotive and Service Station Employees 495, Laundry Workers 52, and Wholesale Delivery Drivers and Salesmen 848.</p>



<p>By 1945 it was just known as the &#8220;Teamsters Hall,&#8221; &#8220;AFL Hall&#8221; or the &#8220;Teamsters Building.&#8221; Here&#8217;s a shot outside 846, showing worker&#8217;s wives protesting the Teamsters&#8217; throwing their husbands out of work for the holidays:</p>

<p>Teamsters Hall was renamed Roosevelt Hall in 1960. The Teamsters moved out about 1977 and in 1978, 846 South Union became the location of California International University and Southland College, later known as the Southland Career Institute. The Lighthouse Mission Church purchases 846 in March 1989, and it has been a church these past thirty-some years.</p>



<p>And <em>that</em> brings us around back to the Church. The property, and its large adjacent parking lot, was purchased in September 2018 by Catholic Charities of Los Angeles, Inc., which is the social service arm of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles. Catholic Charities intends to demolish the building:</p>

<p>This, then, is my message to Catholic Charities&#8217; Executive Director, the Reverend Monsignor Gregory Cox, and its Chairman of the Board of Trustees, the Most Reverend José H. Gomez, Archbishop of Los Angeles:</p>



<p>I support you, of course, unwaveringly, in your alleviation of the material and spiritual poverty of the poor and disenfranchised. Breaking the cycles of poverty, homelessness, illiteracy and violence is especially important for boys and young men transitioning out of foster care, and I applaud the concept of a village catering to their needs and to that end.</p>



<p>Union Avenue Village is a wonderful concept in achieving your goal. But this is a very large property; the 1923 B&#8217;nai B&#8217;rith structure takes up only about a third of it. And it <em>was</em> initially constructed with all manner of convenience (showers, gymnasium, kitchens, etc.) conducive to housing young men. Might I suggest <em>adaptive reuse</em> of the property? Rejuvenating this building would certainly fulfill attractive concerns of sustainability and of the circular economy, to be certain, but I would also argue a more esoteric point—that retaining and maintaining a beautiful old building such as this, a touchstone of the neighborhood and link to the past and our shared cultural heritage, is good for the soul. I would say it uplifts the soul, and serves the people of Los Angeles, to retain 846 South Union and incorporate it into the forthcoming Angel&#8217;s Flight shelter for homeless boys and housing for Transition Age Youth. Moreover, keeping 846 South Union would reverse the trend of the Church&#8217;s propensity toward demolishing historic buildings.</p>



<p>Thank you for your consideration!</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a very special part of the world.  Beverly Boulevard.  You go ahead and cross town on (shudder) the freeways; or traverse the city on, what, Santa Monica (bless your heart); I go in for cruising <em>Beverly</em> when it comes to making my way across Los Angeles. </p>



<p>My favorite stretch on Beverly is this one run, that stretch between Virgil and Western, especially the ten-some blocks between Vermont and Normandie—by and large all one and two-story Spanish-style 1920s structures; the odd car wash; a wonderful 1955 <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Catholic church by the great Ross Montgomery (opens in a new tab)" href="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50916250698_87e7e783b5_o.jpg" target="_blank">Catholic church by the great Ross Montgomery</a> at Arlington Avenue; an excellent <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Late Moderne medical building (opens in a new tab)" href="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50916731162_bdb02d402b_o.png" target="_blank">Late Moderne medical building</a>, also from 1955, by J.

<p>How is it that stepped pylon remained standing after the Parapet Ordinance of 1949, Sylmar, Whittier, Northridge, <em>and</em> a fire in 1985?  Incredible.  These kind of intact mid-30s Moderne markets are rare as hen&#8217;s teeth and a valuable part of the built environment.  (Heck, I bet even Kaplan Chen Kaplan would agree with <em>that</em>!)  In short, it is a rare surviving example of its type and retains its integrity.  </p>



<p>3967-3977 Beverly was designed by Edwin Felix Rudolph (1895-1942) and built in the summer/fall of 1936.  It was funded by Mrs. Alice B. Cohen who lived next door at 301 N. Berendo (more on 301 N. Berendo later).  In 1939 it was the Continental Grocery, by 1945 it was the B &amp; B Meat Market (although I suspect the B &amp; B Meat Market was located <em>inside</em> the Continental Grocery).  </p>

<p>Who was Edwin Felix Rudolph?  He&#8217;s not particularly well-known, Sinaloa Market being, in my humble opinion, his best work (or best <em>known</em> work, there&#8217;s a lot more research to be done on Rudolph).  Here is his 1939 Streamline Moderne industrial building for Central Realty at 3101 East 12th St.—</p>

<p>Rudolph&#8217;s also responsible for the 1939 Safeway packing plant on Vernon east of Alameda; a 1939 San Fernando warehouse and feed mill for San Fernando Milling in Van Nuys; a 1934 market at 1070 West Jefferson (damaged in the &#8217;92 riots, it was thereafter helpfully demolished by the nonprofit &#8220;Rebuild LA&#8221; thus ensuring nothing would be rebuilt there, <em>ever</em>); and was structural engineer for a number of buildings including the recently-landmarked <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Sunset House (opens in a new tab)" href="https://la.curbed.com/2017/11/7/16621394/hollywood-reporter-building-la-landmark" target="_blank">Sunset House</a>/<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Hollywood Reporter (opens in a new tab)" href="https://la.curbed.com/2017/10/26/16554516/hollywood-reporter-building-photos-crossroads" target="_blank">Hollywood Reporter</a>.  </p>



<p>In late 1954 the Continental Grocery/B &amp; B Meat Market became the dental offices of the Hotel and Restaurant Union.  In 1967 the market became the home of a typography/printing/darkroom shop called Ad Compositors.  It reverted back to groceries in 1975 when it became the Wai Wai Market (and one of the few places in town, noted the <em>Times</em> in 1981, to find Thai staples like makrut, nam pla and pickled egg yolks).  It was purchased by Vietnamese refugee Luong Truong in 1985, becoming the Cathay market, and although Truong suffered a disastrous fire there that year, he persevered.  It became the Rancho Sinaloa sometime around 2000.  </p>



<p>Its corner shop at 3977 began life as a malt shop, became a cleaners, was an insurance agent&#8217;s office in the 1950s, and got its bar license in 1965, originally called The Yukon—and was a gay bar, according to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="the records at the One Archives (opens in a new tab)" href="https://one.usc.edu/archive-location/yukon" target="_blank">the records at the One Archives</a>—and was renamed One Eye Jack sometime around 1972. </p>



<p>And because this is RIPLosAngeles, you know where this is going.  Yep:</p>

<p>Brought to you from the good folks of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="4D Development and Investment (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.4ddevelopment.us/" target="_blank">4D Development and Investment</a>.  The design is by <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="AFCO Development (opens in a new tab)" href="http://afcodevelopment.com/portfolio-2/" target="_blank">AFCO Development</a>.  Every time I do one of these posts I think &#8220;well, we&#8217;ve finally hit bottom.  A rendering can&#8217;t get worse than <em>this</em>.&#8221;  And then I&#8217;m pleasantly surprised-horrified.</p>



<p>And yes, it&#8217;s TOC-ridden:   because seven units shall be low income, it gets a sixteen foot increase in legally allowed height, to sixty-six feet; and a 25% decrease in open space around it.  Floor area ratio is upped by 14%, and the whole project has a 70% increase in density.  There&#8217;s only a half a parking spot for each unit.  </p>



<p>So, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="here's the City report on the site (opens in a new tab)" href="https://planning.lacity.org/odocument/9377b302-5453-42aa-a7e3-8f81cd3a3e9a/ENV-2019-2766.pdf" target="_blank">here&#8217;s the Department of City Planning report on the site</a>.  It&#8217;s prepared by some guy named Jason Hernández who, because he works for the City, God bless him, doesn&#8217;t know what the hell he&#8217;s talking about.  For example, he states that the 1936 market is built in 1942, and two houses from 1919 are from 1922, etc.  I mean why should he bother to be sensitive or accurate?  After all he works for the City so kind of <em>has</em> to ensure they get torn down—and the poor kid only makes <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="$92,000 a year (opens in a new tab)" href="https://calsalaries.com/jason-hernandez-635240" target="_blank">$92,000 a year</a> (and that&#8217;s just part-time), so why should we even expect him to be good at his job?  </p>



<p>But then, he&#8217;s probably just getting his information from what he was given by Kaplan Chen Kaplan, who did the Historic Resource Eval report for City Planning.  Hernández wrote on page 26:  <em>&#8220;According to the Historic Resource Evaluation conducted by Kaplan Chen Kaplan on&nbsp;November 22, 2019, none of the four (4) existing buildings were found to&nbsp;have&nbsp;historic significance&nbsp;or have the potential to be a historic resource.&nbsp;&#8220;</em>  Well of course not!  KCK are high-priced consultants-for-hire, utilized frequently by government and developers, routinely hired to tear down your neighborhood, a fact about which I go into some detail <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="here (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.riplosangeles.com/2020/09/05/an-appeal-to-reason-at-1537-south-wilton-pl/" target="_blank">here</a>.  The Office of Historic Resources also says our subject properties are of no historic importance—but only, it states, did it decide so &#8220;<em>after reviewing the Historic Resource Evaluation</em>.&#8221;  Which was just partisan propaganda <em>and</em>, though I guarantee you it was over 200 pages long, contained less pertinent and accurate information in it than this stupid little post does.  C&#8217;mon OHR, you can do better.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s right, immediately to the east, at 301 North Berendo (where Alice B.

<p>301 was constructed in 1919 by builder Samuel W. Spangler, who acted as its architect; Spangler was one of the many LA entrepreneurs who built and sold concrete bungalows in the teens.  It was a restaurant by 1942, when owned by Lucille Rowley, and through the 1950s was Lucille&#8217;s Cottage.  </p>

<p>In 1961 it became, briefly, Young&#8217;s Oriental Inn—&#8221;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="The Oriental Gourmet Spot of Los Angeles (opens in a new tab)" href="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50920947463_67e8fa8ffe_o.png" target="_blank">The Oriental Gourmet Spot of Los Angeles</a>.&#8221;   In 1963 it became the site of the <em>first Peruvian restaurant in the United States</em>.   Others would follow, but <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Inca's (opens in a new tab)" href="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50927797951_ffdeb6cbcf_o.png" target="_blank">Inca&#8217;s</a> was first and always considered best, a highly-regarded red table-clothed affair run by Carlos and Ofelia Binasa and managed by son Gabriel, as the only Peruvian easting establishment to feature serious and authentic dishes; it also had art showings.  The space became Atlactatl in September 1989, and has (had) the best pupusas in town (the southland&#8217;s best pupuserias are located in <em>my</em> neighborhood, but <em>these</em>, these merited driving to). </p>



<p>This it Atlacatl&#8217;s neighbor to the north, 307 North Berendo:</p>

<p>Like Spangler, Ira Allison Marshall was a local realty man, who built, bought and sold bungalows across Los Angeles in the teens, perhaps as many as 250, mostly in the Westlake district.  Marshall built this in early 1919.  It has a wonderful clipped gable roof, and the traditional American Colonial boxed eave return above the porch.  Look at all those original windows!  In December 1979, 301-307 N. Berendo became the International Institute of the Maitre-D&#8217;, which transformed into the National Restaurant Academy in September 1980, and which apparently dissolved in mid-late 1983.  </p>



<p>To the west of our friends on Berendo, at the north of our market, is 306 North Heliotrope: </p>

<p>Again, American Colonial built in 1919, this time for a Ms. Gretta C. Sutherland; the builder was Charles MacMillan.  Gable roofed, hipped n&#8217; clipped, with a wonderful matching clipped hip porch gable.  Tough to see through the security bars but, like the house behind it on Berendo, original sidelights and windows (double hung in this case) and, I hope I don&#8217;t have to point out, marvel of marvels, neither house has been stucco&#8217;d.  </p>

<p>So as I was saying.  All this gets dumpster&#8217;d in favor of this—</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="534" src="https://www.riplosangeles.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-08-at-3.39.37-PM-1024x534.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1521" srcset="https://www.riplosangeles.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-08-at-3.39.37-PM-1024x534.png 1024w, https://www.riplosangeles.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-08-at-3.39.37-PM-300x156.png 300w, https://www.riplosangeles.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-08-at-3.39.37-PM-768x400.png 768w, https://www.riplosangeles.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-08-at-3.39.37-PM-1536x801.png 1536w, https://www.riplosangeles.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-08-at-3.39.37-PM-1568x818.png 1568w, https://www.riplosangeles.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-08-at-3.39.37-PM.png 1657w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Yes<em>, build this and the neighborhood will populate with scissor-door cars and baby strollers  </em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Built to the edges of the street—and monstrous—is a fate we must accept solely for no other reason than it having seven affordable units within.  Because you cannot disagree with <em>housing</em>, because we <em>don&#8217;t build housing</em>!  Except&#8230;there&#8217;s a million of these things going up every day, everywhere.    There were 58,437 market-rate units built in Los Angeles in 17-18-19, plus another 10,877 low-income units; for example, in 2018 specifically, Los Angeles gained only 2,000 residents yet built 16,525 units.  And the number of units added to market in 2020 (although I am without precise numbers as the Department of Finance has yet to release them) has skyrocketed, in part because of implementation of the ADU Ordinance, even despite COVID (not to mention the 8,000 new units for homeless families, built via PropHHH).</p>



<p>So why, then, are rents so high?  Well, as regards newly-built units added to the housing stock, it has much to do with the exorbitant cost of building in Los Angeles—apart from our high land acquisition costs, it runs about $400/sf to build here, given the very steep cost of labor, high cost of construction materials, and meeting our particular building regulatory codes (solar, sprinklers, etc.); our permitting fees, which are nothing compared to all the escalating school, parks, and other government-mandated fees (LAUSD&#8217;s fee alone for this project will run about $425,000); the pricey soft costs of architects and engineers, and then you have to deal with property taxes, and so on.  No-one is going to build if they can&#8217;t recoup their investment (unless it&#8217;s a government project, of course) and they wouldn&#8217;t build this if it wouldn&#8217;t turn a profit; not turning a profit makes people get fired.  It stands to reason, then, <em>someone</em> is paying $4,000/mo to live in a studio.</p>



<p>That said, there has been <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="much talk (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.counterpunch.org/2020/10/06/vacant-housing-and-homelessness-in-la/" target="_blank">much talk</a> about how many of these new units are built as luxury units, and many sit empty, and the answer therefore is slapping the owners with a vacancy tax.  I would contend, however, that it is not the private sector&#8217;s responsibility to alleviate social ills.   But they do, in fact, indirectly—the bulk of LA&#8217;s upkeep is paid for by real estate:  of the City of Los Angeles&#8217; $5billion annual budget, $3.5billion comes from property taxes and permitting/fees.  This year we&#8217;ll spend nearly a half-billion of that haul on the homeless crisis, which many contend is not nearly enough.  You know, $130million of this year&#8217;s budget is going to the City Attorneys office—<em>that</em> could build subsidized units rather than pay for those endless $400/hr attorneys, right?  $52million is earmarked to pay salaries at City Planning, who—as I&#8217;ve demonstrated—hire incompetents and worse, pay for expensive, lavish studies written by venal jackals (who, in their defense, are at least <em>competent</em> at<em> </em>turning out those depressingly repetitious &#8220;this significant structure is insignificant!&#8221; studies).  Cut <em>their</em> budget and spend <em>that</em> money on affordable housing—you know, without cutting Office of Historic Resources, naturally.</p>



<p>But forgive my thinking out loud—I&#8217;m neither an authority on housing crises nor their resolutions, so don&#8217;t take to me task on the previous paragraphs.  I just like to look at old buildings.  Which is becoming an increasingly difficult pleasure, since developers keep tearing them down, aided and abetted by a local government that&#8217;s making bank on the process.  </p>

<p>I am forever fascinated by GrowLA&#8217;s <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Facebook page (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/GrowLA" target="_blank">Facebook page</a>.

<p>Need I say, the <em>opposite</em> of this graphic is the actual truth.  According to studies by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development, and all their various graphs involving demographic cross-tabulations of USFPP vs PPB (Unit Square Footage-Per-Person, Person-Per-Bedoom) and so forth, Americans in houses are &#8220;overhoused,&#8221; meaning they have more elbow room, while Americans in denser areas and multiunits are &#8220;underhoused,&#8221; i.e., suffering from overcrowding.  This is true across all spectrums of race and ethnicity, income, metropolitan area, citizenship, etc.  Don&#8217;t know if the YIMBYs made an honest mistake here, or they&#8217;re just lying liars who lie.  I&#8217;m willing to give them the benefit of the doubt, of course.</p>



<p>What sort of thing gets posted on GrowLA?  This is typical:  </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="853" height="835" src="https://www.riplosangeles.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-13-at-7.02.23-PM.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1474" srcset="https://www.riplosangeles.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-13-at-7.02.23-PM.png 853w, https://www.riplosangeles.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-13-at-7.02.23-PM-300x294.png 300w, https://www.riplosangeles.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-13-at-7.02.23-PM-768x752.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 853px) 100vw, 853px" /><figcaption><em>It&#8217;s like looking down the Norden bombsight</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>There&#8217;s you answer, &#8220;get&#8221; the City of Los Angeles to &#8220;do this,&#8221; what, through eminent domain?  Tearing down single family homes is <em>always</em> the answer.  (We&#8217;ll ignore the fact that 5,000+ units are already<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" under construction for UCLA right now (opens in a new tab)" href="https://urbanize.city/la/post/progress-report-uclas-870m-student-housing-expansion" target="_blank"> under construction for UCLA right now</a>.)</p>



<p>And what are we to replace Los Angeles&#8217; single-family-dwellings <em>with</em>?  Micro-Units, of course!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="990" src="https://www.riplosangeles.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-13-at-7.00.13-PM-1024x990.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1475" srcset="https://www.riplosangeles.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-13-at-7.00.13-PM-1024x990.png 1024w, https://www.riplosangeles.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-13-at-7.00.13-PM-300x290.png 300w, https://www.riplosangeles.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-13-at-7.00.13-PM-768x743.png 768w, https://www.riplosangeles.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-13-at-7.00.13-PM.png 1059w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption><em>How can it be spread, John?

<p>When you read this article, you&#8217;re supposed to feel warm and fuzzy because look! there&#8217;s more units and they COST LESS!  Win for millennials! </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="502" height="216" src="https://www.riplosangeles.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-15-at-1.41.09-PM.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1477" srcset="https://www.riplosangeles.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-15-at-1.41.09-PM.png 502w, https://www.riplosangeles.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-15-at-1.41.09-PM-300x129.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 502px) 100vw, 502px" /></figure>

<p>Of course, what they fail to explicate:   When you spend that $2,305 for a one-bedroom you are getting on average 768 square feet.  That is because average rent around there is $3/sf.  <em>Ergo</em>, the 265 square foot apartment at MicroUnitz <em>should</em> cost $795 a month.  <em>Why</em> then would you pay $1500, or $5.66 a square foot, for your tiny place, when $5.66/sf is the going rate in Beverly Hills?  But think of the amenities!  Like not&#8230;having&#8230;parking&#8230;or a closet.</p>



<p>But you&#8217;re not supposed to ask these questions.  You&#8217;re supposed to just accept that we can add millions of new people to Los Angeles—it will all be ok because we can tear down the old neighborhoods, those homes and lawns and trees, and learn to live with <em>less</em>.  (I wrote a little bit about glorified dorm life <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="in this post (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.riplosangeles.com/2019/10/13/so-ugly-too-ugly/" target="_blank">in this post</a>.) It has been said that living with less is good for the environment, and far be it from me to argue with <em>that</em>.  What it does to your soul be damned, of course.  The individual (and certainly the soul) are outdated concepts, anyway.</p>



<p>The new way of living is certainly the pod.

<p>Well then I guess I don&#8217;t know <em>what</em> will happen.  People like me will keep complaining I suppose, but I am after all <em>the problem</em>, according to our pals at GrowLA:</p>

<p>Of course during these lock&#8217;d-down times (to think, I remember when they were just loc&#8217;d out) the demolition of Los Angeles has managed to continue apace. While the act of your shopping six-feet-apart at the local mom&amp; pop is <em>definitely going to kill our collective grandma</em> (and no, you&#8217;re not allowed to go to her funeral either), a yard full of dudes shoulder to shoulder yelling and sweating and tearing down vintage houses to build Khrushchyovkas, well, <em>that</em> in fact makes those fellows <em>immune</em> to Coronavirus. <em>Trust the science</em>.</p>



<p>Now then. Let&#8217;s talk for a sec about a building that has no immediate threat of which I am aware. No permit has been taken out in anger against it. But still.</p>



<p>Here she is, 915 South Grand View St.</p>

<p>915 Grand View was purchased from developer Stimson by William Horatio Sanders, who, though his parents were English, was born in Scotland, in June 1839. He came to America in 1860 at twenty, going to work on the railroads; he married Emma Ellsworth in Minnesota in 1878. He and Emma came to Pomona in the eighties, where W. H. worked as a civil engineer. He became a partner in the Los Angeles-based engineering firm of Quinton, Olmsted &amp; Sanders, and moved from Pomona to Los Angeles to be closer to the action. W.H. also worked as an engineer for the newly-formed United States Reclamation Service Railroad when he and Emma pulled up Pomona stakes and bought Grand View. They lived there until he passed away in the house, in 1924; Emma moved back to Pomona and passed in March 1942 (she was fifteen years his junior).</p>



<p>After 1924 it becomes the home and chiropractic offices of Dr. George Shabo (who builds the garage in back in 1932); he and his wife Vera live there until his death in 1949. It remains single family until owner Joseph Gary converts a couple rooms to apartments in 1961.</p>

<p>So why do I bring up this charming old home? It sold last week, on December 21st. The realtor copy—as penned by Paul Yoo of Keller Williams— reads thus:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="898" height="738" class="wp-image-1461" src="https://www.riplosangeles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/wwoo.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.riplosangeles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/wwoo.png 898w, https://www.riplosangeles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/wwoo-300x247.png 300w, https://www.riplosangeles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/wwoo-768x631.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 898px) 100vw, 898px" /></figure>



<p>The mention that 915 is an &#8220;excellent opportunity for developers to acquire prime property on an R4 zoned and TOC Tier 3 lot&#8221; is what, I would wager, sealed the deal. Therefore, according to its TOC, this 117-y.o. two-unit with the hedges and the rock wall will likely become a thirteen-unit, pushed right to the sidewalk, 22&#8242; higher than surrounding buildings, etc. On the other hand, maybe the new owner will keep it a duplex with the church, or <em>heck</em>, even return the whole thing to an SFD! Because that happens so often.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, you shelter in place. Your whole neighborhood is clamped down tight. Then why is there no calm in the world? Why, when you are trying to sleep at eight in the morning—because Lord knows you can&#8217;t go to <em>work</em>—there&#8217;s hammering and high-pitched tile saws everywhere? Because the building of high priced condos is <em>essential work</em>. Everybody <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/03/28/construction-lockdown-coronavirus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="knows (opens in a new tab)">knows</a> <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-04-02/coronavirus-los-angeles-tenant-renovations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="that (opens in a new tab)">that</a>.</p>



<p>So keep an eye on your neighbor. No, not to spy on their mask-wearing. On their purchase of moving boxes. Chances are good they&#8217;re getting the <a href="https://ktla.com/news/california/californias-population-growth-rate-at-record-low-as-more-people-leave/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="hell (opens in a new tab)">hell</a> <a href="https://www.livabl.com/2020/10/la-residents-moving-away-2020.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="out (opens in a new tab)">out</a>. Then a bunch of investors will swoop in, purchase their place. These newfolk will gleefully tear down what&#8217;s left of Old LA, and haul in a hundred heavy-breathing workers, a-hammering furiously. A million units built nice and dense, housing crisis ended! Just like the <em>last</em> time a bunch of new units were added to the stock, <a href="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50768827896_c1f43490ca_o.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="which certainly cured us (opens in a new tab)">which certainly cured us</a>. This time it may be a little different though. New immigrants into California will pay the rent with&#8230;what? The odd $600 check?</p>



<p>I&#8217;ll just be sad when they tear down 915 Grand View.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s say you&#8217;re living peacefully in your vintage home on your block of gracious low-slung craftsmans when some developer decides to tear down the house next door to put in something grossly out-of-scale.  You&#8217;re shocked that it will block light and air and views and ruin parking and cause noise and destroy the historic fabric of your neighborhood and the whole magilla.  <em>Surely</em> you can lay out your concerns to the Powers That Be in the form of an appeal to which they&#8217;ll listen thoughtfully and say, My God, You&#8217;re Right.  Maybe in this case we <em>shouldn&#8217;t</em> worship at the altar of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Scott Wiener (opens in a new tab)" href="https://californiaglobe.com/section-2/senator-wiener-introduces-sb-50-lite-housing-bill/" target="_blank">Scott Wiener</a> and fall in lockstep with the abjuration of zoning ordinances.  </p>



<p>Or, the City might tell you to go screw.  </p>



<p>Take for example 1537 South Wilton Place.  It was built in 1905 and designed by Charles F. Whittlesey.  The F is for Effing, because this house was designed by <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="CHARLES EFFING WHITTLESEY (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Frederick_Whittlesey" target="_blank">CHARLES EFFING WHITTLESEY</a>.  </p>

<p>So the neighbors approached the City and said, hey, we&#8217;re filing an <em>appeal</em>, in that there&#8217;s a few problems here.  They pointed out that the South Los Angeles Community Plan Design Guidelines/Citywide Residential Design Guidelines require new developments to respect the scale and architecture and identity of the surrounding historic neighborhood, especially as this neighborhood falls under the Character Residential Overlay as implemented by the City Council to protect the historic neighborhoods in South Los Angeles.  Plus the developer screwed up the math on the TOC Incentives, getting them all kinds of wrong, as further miscalculated by City staff.  And you can&#8217;t just make the project vested for land use entitlements and CEQA exempt because you feel like it.  And so on.</p>



<p>And to all of this the City replied.  They replied well, <em>you</em> say your neighborhood has a certain character, but <em>we</em> say your neighborhood has all <em>sorts</em> of weird buildings, so stop worrying about it, and so as to you and your Citywide Design Guidelines, we dismiss your concerns utterly.   For example, when you say two stories is the prevailing height on the block, we reply with, basically, <em>sure</em>, <em>true</em>, but <em>so what</em> (and implying as well, you terrible people, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="if we don't hand the developers the extra height it won't &quot;pencil out&quot; and then how can we have those two whole extra low income units? (opens in a new tab)" href="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50309100763_43e4835ac0_o.png" target="_blank">if we don&#8217;t hand the developers the extra height then the project won&#8217;t &#8220;pencil out&#8221; and then how, oh <em>how</em> can we have those <em>two whole</em> low-income units?</a>).  Oh, and all that stuff about entitlements and  TOC?  Well, don&#8217;t even <em>try</em> to argue TOC.  It&#8217;s TOC, man.   </p>



<p><em>But</em>, said the Department of City Planning&#8217;s City Planning Commission, we <em>do</em> agree that neither the developers nor us gave one <em>piddling</em> <em>iota</em> of thought or care as to whether 1537 might be a potential historic resource, so <em>tell ya what</em>, we will hire some <em>real live architects</em>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Kaplan Chen Kaplan (opens in a new tab)" href="http://kckarchitects.com/about/" target="_blank">Kaplan Chen Kaplan</a>, to do a Historic Resource Evaluation Report on this here Whittlesey house.  </p>



<p>KCK came back and said the Whittlesey house was absolute worthless crap, devoid of all merit in every conceivable way.   KCK&#8217;s report was some 100+ pages and, since they bill on average at $200/hour, I can assure you, was not cheap.  <em>Your tax dollars at work!</em>  For example, KCK hired an <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="RPA Certified Archaeologist to check records (opens in a new tab)" href="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50310458167_6e670affb8_o.png" target="_blank">RPA Certified Archaeologist to check records</a>, which is akin to hunting mosquitos with an elephant gun; it&#8217;s the kind of work you give to Bob the Unpaid Intern and and he does it on his lunchbreak.  Hell, it&#8217;s the elemental gruntwork I save for when I&#8217;m hungover and do it in <em>half</em> my lunchbreak.  </p>



<p>KCK&#8217;s report was written primarily by &#8220;historic consultant&#8221; Pam O&#8217;Connor, whom you specifically hire when you want to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="make sure something is described as &quot;not worthy. (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.wehoville.com/2020/02/19/in-a-4-1-vote-council-denies-property-owners-appeal-of-historic-designation-for-1251-detroit/" target="_blank">make sure something is described as &#8220;unworthy of preservation</a>.&#8221;  When Mayor of Santa Monica, she fought to remove <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.surfsantamonica.com/ssm_site/the_lookout/news/News-2005/July-2005/07_14_05_Council_Overturns_Landmark_Status.htm" target="_blank">landmark status and tear down landmarks</a>.  O&#8217;Connor is best known as the only Santa Monica council member to lobby <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="against Millard Sheets (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.smdp.com/wilshire-buildings-gets-landmark-status/160366" target="_blank">against Millard Sheets</a>.  Look at <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="these Late Moderne and Modern buildings on North Central in Glendale (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.glendaleca.gov/Home/ShowDocument?id=7340" target="_blank">these Late Moderne and Modern buildings on North Central in Glendale</a>.  Does O&#8217;Connor understand them <em>at all</em>?  No, she does not.  (Or maybe she secretly does, but still has to recommend their destruction, because that&#8217;s her damn job.)</p>



<p>In any event, some snorty guffaws and one Very Expensive and Useless Study later, and the City sat down to thoughtfully consider the neighborhood&#8217;s appeal.  Which is precisely why they own a comically oversized rubber DENIED stamp they use to pound upon appeals with an embarrassingly ebullient and theatrical flourish.  </p>

<p>Up in the Valley there&#8217;s an indication as to how we used to live.  Low slung structures, lots of open space.  Cool shade from the towering trees.  This is, of course, a rare, precious, disappearing commodity.  </p>



<p>In the autumn of 1939 a fellow named P. N. Morgan designed and built a twelve-room, four family residential structure just off Lankershim in North Hollywood, at 10912 Blix.  Then, a chap named W. Charles Swett saw what Morgan did, and liked it so much that in the spring of 1940 he pulled permits to put up one very much like it on the adjoining property at 10916, hiring engineer/architect Edward Rudolph to design another one-story, twelve-room four-unit.</p>



<p>Look how nicely the two work together.  See how they form a sort of allée, passing through a planted boscage.  </p>

<p>So you may remember my &#8220;Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Taix* (*But Were Afraid to Ask)&#8221; <a href="https://riplosangeles.com/2019/09/06/lets-talk-about-taix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="post from September (opens in a new tab)">post from September</a>.</p>



<p>Of course, since you read this blog, you&#8217;ve probably already seen the recently-released renderings of Taix&#8217;s forthcoming replacement, but I would be remiss in my duties were I not to make mention of them here.</p>



<p>So. Remember what I said in September&#8217;s post about how you&#8217;d have to have a dead soul to not be charmed by Taix&#8217;s faux-French village vernacular? Well, you&#8217;d have to be born with <em>no</em> soul to love this:</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="483" src="https://www.riplosangeles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/HollandsOpus-1024x483.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1378" srcset="https://www.riplosangeles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/HollandsOpus-1024x483.png 1024w, https://www.riplosangeles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/HollandsOpus-300x142.png 300w, https://www.riplosangeles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/HollandsOpus-768x362.png 768w, https://www.riplosangeles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/HollandsOpus-1536x725.png 1536w, https://www.riplosangeles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/HollandsOpus-1568x740.png 1568w, https://www.riplosangeles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/HollandsOpus.png 1992w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption><em>A magical pairing of dirty stucco and mustard-beige </em></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Missed Taix? It&#8217;s over there:</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="687" src="https://www.riplosangeles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-24-at-7.07.17-PM-1024x687.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1380" srcset="https://www.riplosangeles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-24-at-7.07.17-PM-1024x687.png 1024w, https://www.riplosangeles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-24-at-7.07.17-PM-300x201.png 300w, https://www.riplosangeles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-24-at-7.07.17-PM-768x516.png 768w, https://www.riplosangeles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-24-at-7.07.17-PM.png 1217w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption><em>No no, down there, next to my favorite shop, Retail</em></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Now I&#8217;m not implying that the good people at Togawa-Smith-Martin have no souls. I&#8217;m sure they cast reflections in mirrors and <em>everything</em>. It&#8217;s just that those people who get hot for their &#8220;brown stack o&#8217; boxes with metal parts and some balconies&#8221; <a href="http://www.tsminc.com/projects/garey-building/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="style (opens in a new tab)">style</a>, <em>those</em> people I worry about.</p>



<p>But such people don&#8217;t exist, I hear you say, and you are correct. Even the Curbed commenters, wetting themselves with glee over the destruction of Taix, admit that this blah-dern blandmark embarrasses the lot of us. They also admit that the new Taix will not succeed; without the charm of its architecture, and the ambience of its interior, it will fail worse than the French agricultural harvest of 1788. And we all know how that turned out.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="542" src="https://www.riplosangeles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-24-at-8.32.46-PM-1024x542.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1381" srcset="https://www.riplosangeles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-24-at-8.32.46-PM-1024x542.png 1024w, https://www.riplosangeles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-24-at-8.32.46-PM-300x159.png 300w, https://www.riplosangeles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-24-at-8.32.46-PM-768x407.png 768w, https://www.riplosangeles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-24-at-8.32.46-PM-1536x813.png 1536w, https://www.riplosangeles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-24-at-8.32.46-PM-1568x830.png 1568w, https://www.riplosangeles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-24-at-8.32.46-PM.png 1675w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption><em>Dear Lord I fell asleep just posting a picture of it. It&#8217;s like the Colin Robinson of architecture.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>What, then? Are we resigned to her destruction? Perhaps not. There is, after all, Les Amis de Taix, dedicated to her retention and preservation (their <a href="https://www.change.org/p/save-taix-french-restaurant" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="petition is here (opens in a new tab)">petition is here</a>). Esotouric has a <a href="https://esotouric.substack.com/p/shock-horror-developers-beg-as-los" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="fascinating theory (opens in a new tab)">fascinating theory</a> that Holland Group purposely turned the destruction and resurrection of Taix into a trainwreck just to sink the project, a big fat write-off as we head into an economic slowdown being, you know, better than nothing.</p>



<p>But, I hear you say, you can&#8217;t possibly want to stop a project like this, because <em>housing!</em>  Oh you and your bizarre strange-bedfellow propaganda from Billionaire Fatcat Developers and best pals Big Government Leftist Ideologues.  Who tell us how we&#8217;re to live, when they don&#8217;t even live here—Clyde Holland lives in Vancouver and Scott Wiener lives in San Francisco (ok, maybe <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="not (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.housinghumanright.org/selling-out-california-scott-wiener-money-ties-to-big-real-estate/" target="_blank">not</a> such strange bedfellows).  </p>



<p>Besides, Holland Residential is famous for illegally Airbnb’ing its units.&nbsp;True, this they have denied and responded by saying “well, our units are rented by corporate clients and THEY Airbnb them, not us!”&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, well, either way, I’m sure we have therewith ended the housing crisis, and good for all of us.</p>



<p>Ultimately, Taix must be destroyed because its architecture connotes &#8220;little European village.&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp;It positively <em>reeks</em> of the wholesome and virtuous.&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not popular to make value judgments extolling the positive aspects of European culture these days:&nbsp;&nbsp;it’s hip as hell to hate on Europe as hard as you possibly can—well,&nbsp;<em>old</em> Europe anyway.&nbsp;&nbsp;God forbid something as simple as some half-timbering might make you meditate on truth, beauty, devotion, tradition; all anathema to the modern world.&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#8217;m surprised people aren&#8217;t protesting it.</p>



<p>And Taix has <em>whimsy</em>. Gads, people today sure hate whimsy. (I mean I know millennials are supposed to be a joyless bunch but enough already. Embrace whimsy, ya knuckleheads!)</p>



<p>Whither Taix? It&#8217;s going to be a strange and fascinating ride&#8230;as is everything in this deeply polluted world. For which I have nothing but hope. Stay tuned.</p>

<p>Greetings all!  Marsak here.  Remember when I used to look at demo permits and blog about the structures?  Good times.  I&#8217;ll get back to it, I swear.  I&#8217;ve been completely consumed with this book project the last few months.  Big thank-you to Kim who&#8217;s been keeping the flame alive here at RIP!  </p>



<p>But I saw this today and just had to toss it out there.  There&#8217;s an Instagram page called southlabuildings, which I love, because I love South Los Angeles so damn much.  </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="658" src="https://www.riplosangeles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-19-at-1.17.18-PM-1024x658.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1362" srcset="https://www.riplosangeles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-19-at-1.17.18-PM-1024x658.png 1024w, https://www.riplosangeles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-19-at-1.17.18-PM-300x193.png 300w, https://www.riplosangeles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-19-at-1.17.18-PM-768x494.png 768w, https://www.riplosangeles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-19-at-1.17.18-PM-1536x987.png 1536w, https://www.riplosangeles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-19-at-1.17.18-PM-1568x1008.png 1568w, https://www.riplosangeles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-19-at-1.17.18-PM.png 1598w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption><em>Go add them on your IG</em></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>And I love this house to an absurd degree.  It was listed for sale recently.  The listing read in part:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="712" height="557" src="https://www.riplosangeles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-19-at-1.31.25-PM.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1363" srcset="https://www.riplosangeles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-19-at-1.31.25-PM.png 712w, https://www.riplosangeles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-19-at-1.31.25-PM-300x235.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 712px) 100vw, 712px" /><figcaption><em>Which reads &#8220;tear this down and build a giant-ass box you crazy bastards!&#8221;</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The house was listed, relisted and delisted, so who knows what&#8217;s going on with it.  There is/was apparently a demo permit issued, as evidenced by this photo, though there&#8217;s nothing about the issuance of a demolition permit proper at City Planning or on ZIMAS—</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="999" height="1007" src="https://www.riplosangeles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-19-at-1.41.07-PM.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1364" srcset="https://www.riplosangeles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-19-at-1.41.07-PM.png 999w, https://www.riplosangeles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-19-at-1.41.07-PM-298x300.png 298w, https://www.riplosangeles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-19-at-1.41.07-PM-150x150.png 150w, https://www.riplosangeles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-19-at-1.41.07-PM-768x774.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 999px) 100vw, 999px" /></figure>



<p>Although at DBS we do have confirmation that they&#8217;ve gone through and have had their Plan Check approved, which does not bode well—</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="791" height="781" src="https://www.riplosangeles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-19-at-5.36.53-PM.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1370" srcset="https://www.riplosangeles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-19-at-5.36.53-PM.png 791w, https://www.riplosangeles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-19-at-5.36.53-PM-300x296.png 300w, https://www.riplosangeles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-19-at-5.36.53-PM-768x758.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 791px) 100vw, 791px" /></figure>



<p>So let&#8217;s talk a bit about this house.  Of course every developer from God-knows-where wants to tear it down—to build a superdense coronavirus hotbox that looks like some preteen&#8217;s Jenga tower—and, I might add, without a thought of moving it.  Moving it, you say?  Who does that?  Well you know, it <em>was</em> moved here after all.  </p>



<p>That&#8217;s right, it came from somewhere else.  Figueroa south of downtown used to be full of grand homes, once upon a time (like, say, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimson_House" target="_blank">this one</a>).  And Martin Bekins&#8217;s house at 1341 South Figueroa St., built in the spring/summer of 1907, was one of them.  Martin Bekins is yes, THAT Bekins.  Read more about him <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.newnetherlandinstitute.org/history-and-heritage/dutch_americans/martin-bekins/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1989-03-01-vw-725-story.html" target="_blank">here</a>.  Bekins &amp; family stayed in the house until downtown grew up around them and in the early-mid 1920s built something larger and with more property <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="out in Eagle Rock (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.realtor.com/news/unique-homes/chateau-emanuel-eagle-rock/" target="_blank">out in Eagle Rock</a>.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="641" height="372" src="https://www.riplosangeles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-19-at-3.42.18-PM.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1367" srcset="https://www.riplosangeles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-19-at-3.42.18-PM.png 641w, https://www.riplosangeles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-19-at-3.42.18-PM-300x174.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 641px) 100vw, 641px" /><figcaption><em>When you live in a big house on Figueroa, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="muckety-mucks (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Stephens" target="_blank">muckety-mucks</a> come speak in your living room, and then you make them governor </em></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The architect of 1341 South Figueroa was John A. Mathis.  Mathis came to Los Angeles in 1885 and established the Mathis Construction Company.  He built all over the southland.  Below is another Mathis house; from what I can tell, it and Bronson are the sole remaining two.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="697" src="https://www.riplosangeles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-19-at-2.15.22-PM-1024x697.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1365" srcset="https://www.riplosangeles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-19-at-2.15.22-PM-1024x697.png 1024w, https://www.riplosangeles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-19-at-2.15.22-PM-300x204.png 300w, https://www.riplosangeles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-19-at-2.15.22-PM-768x522.png 768w, https://www.riplosangeles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-19-at-2.15.22-PM.png 1060w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption><em>2225 West Twentieth St., J. A. Mathis, 1905.  This house just underwent renovation and restoration.  Why can&#8217;t our friend on Bronson?  C&#8217;mon Jefferson Park!  Don&#8217;t let West Adams make a fool of ya!</em></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Anyway, after Bekins moved to Eagle Rock in the mid-1920s, the spot at 1341 was needed for something else (Bekins Co. built a commercial structure on the site, which disappeared in the early 1970s, and it&#8217;s all Convention Center down there now), so the house was picked up and moved by Welte House Moving Co. in the spring of 1929, where she&#8217;s been ever since.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="661" src="https://www.riplosangeles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-19-at-2.39.12-PM-1024x661.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1366" srcset="https://www.riplosangeles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-19-at-2.39.12-PM-1024x661.png 1024w, https://www.riplosangeles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-19-at-2.39.12-PM-300x194.png 300w, https://www.riplosangeles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-19-at-2.39.12-PM-768x496.png 768w, https://www.riplosangeles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-19-at-2.39.12-PM-1536x992.png 1536w, https://www.riplosangeles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-19-at-2.39.12-PM-1568x1012.png 1568w, https://www.riplosangeles.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-19-at-2.39.12-PM.png 2037w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption><em>And there</em>&#8216;s<em> a wishing well!  Let&#8217;s all go toss in some coins and envision her restoration</em></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>I mean look at the old girl.  Not stucco&#8217;d, the chimneys are there, all original windows, the porches haven&#8217;t been enclosed&#8230;incredible.  Large corner lot. If ever a home could come back, and be a showplace and a feather in the cap of Los Angeles, it is this one.   </p>



<p>So what say ye, Los Angeles?</p>

<p>Episode 26 finds Nathan and his wee pal The Los Angeles Preservation Imp at 11th &amp; Hill, kitty corner from the Herald Examiner, at the scene of a recent fire that’s had fans of the faux log cabin diner that’s occupied the corner since 1933 worried sick.</p>
<p>But the diner’s designer Ken Bemis was a super genius, praised in Fortune Magazine for his &#8220;cat-like brain, which, dropped from anywhere, always lands on its feet.&#8221; The building might look like an old New England log cabin, but was in fact a patented ultra-modern fire-proof marvel, its concrete “logs” poured into versatile wall and window molds that could be reconfigured to taste, or packed up to move to a new site with ease. The fire had scarcely scorched the place.</p>
<p>While skipping happily around the undamaged log cabin, and letting the imp root around in the burned fixtures tossed around back, Nathan encounters a couple of interested parties, and lets loose with a little improvisational preservation advocacy.</p>
<p>We know it’s strange to see people walking around, coming up to talk to each other, touching their faces and so forth, yet this was our beloved Los Angeles just a month ago. And while we shelter in place and do our best to look out for one another and our beloved local landmarks from afar, there is just one ray of sunshine we can’t help but bask in: the perceived wisdom that every small, cool, historic building like the White Log Coffee Shop that sits on valuable Downtown L.A. real estate is doomed is over now. There are hard times ahead for Los Angeles, that’s certain, but we might just get to hang on to more of our landmarks. And what are we without them? Cranky, that’s what!</p>
<p>Where will the Cranky Preservationist turn up next? <a href="https://www.riplosangeles.com/">Stay tuned</a>!</p>
