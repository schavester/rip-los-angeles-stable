					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.riplosangeles.com/371-n-st-andrews-update/#comment-13&quot;&gt;C.C.&lt;/a&gt;.

Hey C. C. !  So, if you&#039;re looking for demolition permits in general in the last couple weeks, go to http://planning.lacity.org/ and click &quot;Case Reports&quot; in the green bar, that will open a window called &quot;Latest Cases&quot; which is about the last two weeks&#039; worth.

If you&#039;re looking for information pertaining to a particular address, there&#039;s http://zimas.lacity.org/ which&#039;ll give you stuff like year built and most recent case numbers.  

For my money though you want to go to DBS records at http://ladbsdoc.lacity.org/idispublic/ and I usually order them by date.  LA records were lost pre-1905, so that can be a problem.  But at least more recent stuff like demo permits should be there.  

Protip:  when searching an address in DBS make sure you&#039;ve checked every last variation of the address (in the upper left hand side of the Zimas listing) especially if that property is on a corner.  

Don&#039;t know if any of this helps, PM me if you need screenshots of stuff perhaps?  N]]></description>
